ABSTRACT : 
The project focuses on displaying vital information to an adventurist via a heads up display system. This is achieved by using a Raspberry Pi Model B, GPS module, Ultrasonic Sensors and the Humidity and Temperature sensors. At first these sensors pick up vital information and relay the information via the LCD display. At the same time, the GPS module picks up the position of the adventurist on the basis of his co-ordinates with respect to satellites and this can be logged and kept in the Raspberry Pi for future use. This concept can be broadly classified into three phases: 

 SENSOR DETECTION: The first stage involves observing the environment, detecting the temperature, humidity and representing them in a suitable format.
 SENSOR RECOGNITION: This intermediate stage performs the processing of detected sensors and effectively identifies them in order to be used for display or logging purposes. 

 INFORMATION RELAY: This step focuses on relaying the formatted information onto the LCD Display with a good readability and with appropriate update time.
